# VHIN
Hi, I created token **VHIN** and a contract to exchange that token for USDC(VHINSwaper).
## What is VHIN
VHIN is a stablecoin that benefits from exchanging it with my contract.<br>
Contract takes 0.4% from every transaction and adds it to treasure(which I misspelled in the code :) ) and that increases price of VHIN token and you will buy and sell for new price.<br>
Price is calculated for every buy and sell of token with a precision of 4 decimals.<br>
I take 0.1% of every transaction(in USDC) for other projects(involving this token).
